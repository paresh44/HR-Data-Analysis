# HR-Data-Analysis
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project focused on human resources (HR) data. The project aims to analyze HR metrics to gain insights into employee performance, engagement, retention, and other key factors impacting organizational success.
The analysis consists of several key steps:

1)Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The raw HR data is cleaned, standardized, and prepared for analysis in Excel. This involves handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and trend analysis are performed in Excel to gain an understanding of the data distribution and identify patterns and insights.

3)Data Modeling and Visualization: The cleaned data is imported into Power BI for further analysis and visualization. Interactive dashboards and reports are created to present key HR metrics such as turnover rates, employee satisfaction scores, and performance trends.
